<p>20220924 - Added Class Map, Added Part of Class Vector3f, Added Class Angle... Testing...</p>
<p>20220925 - Vector3f - Corrections & Additions. Testing...</p>
<p>20220926 - Relabeled class Vector3f to Vector3... Testing...</p>
<p>20220927 - Relabeled class Vector3 to Vector... Testing... </p>
<p>20220927 - Tuples.h ... Testing... </p>
<p>20220927 - Point.h ... Testing... </p>
<p>20220927 - Notice the use of both Point & Vector classes working together. Decided to do Hierachies instead of Associative Relationships with pointers... Thinking that the number of static globals will increase over time.</p>
<p>20220928 - Angles.h ... Testing... </p>
<p>20221008 - Rewrote all classes... </p>
<p>20221009 - DeltaTime.h & Motion.h ... Testing... Updated Vector3.h</p>
<p>20221012 -Updated Vector3.h * Matrix3x3.h and Tests.h</p>
<p>20221013 -Rewrote Vector.h Point.h Matrix.h - Moved Angle.h methods to Math.h and removed Angle.h - Relationships is the issue? Maybe!</p>
