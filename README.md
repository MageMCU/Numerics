## Algebra OOP Library

The math is underneath the namespace called Numerics as in numeric computation. An interesting note on cross-platform is try converting a library for MCU devices that originated from desktop computers. The code conversion by keyboard occurs while plugged-in to the Arduino Uno board. The desktop Algebra OOP Library is written in C# and is privately used for the Unity Game Engine for robotic simulations.

## Numerics

The Numerics is math computations needed to further the study in robotics. Numerics is developed and tested on an Arduino board and then it will be used in a SBC and a MCU. The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost single-board computer used to teach computer science. The microcontroller like the Atmega328P is also low-cost and is sold on the popular Arduino Uno board.

## Testing Platform

This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.

**PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 

**Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.

## Issues

No issues..., other than **class Matrix** is presently in development...

## In Development

The Numerics project is active.
