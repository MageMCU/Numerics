## Algebra OOP Library
- The math is underneath the namespace ***csjc***.

## Numerics
- The Numerics Library is math computations used to further the study in robotics. Numerics is developed and tested on an Arduino board. The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost single-board computer used to teach computer science. The microcontroller like the Atmega328P is also low-cost and is sold on the popular Arduino Uno board.

## Testing Platform
- This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.
- **PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 
- **Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.
